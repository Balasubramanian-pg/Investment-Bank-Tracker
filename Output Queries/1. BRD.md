## **Executive Summary**

This document identifies and articulates critical analytical gaps in current reporting and dashboard proposals. Each query has been assessed through a business analysis lens to determine missing inputs, overlooked relationships, and the strategic decisions that could be compromised without rectification. The goal is to convert raw analytical ideas into business-aligned, decision-oriented deliverables.

## **Methodology**

Each analytical use case was evaluated across four dimensions:

1. **Completeness of Data Inputs**
2. **Missing Relationships or Linkages**
3. **Business Decision Affected**
4. **Strategic or Operational Implication**

This gap mapping ensures alignment between analytical effort and business value â€” essential for prioritization and stakeholder buy-in.

---

## **Recommendations**

1. **Enrich Source Data Pipelines**

   * Incorporate missing financial, relationship, and macroeconomic dimensions where feasible.

2. **Collaborate with Domain Experts**

   * Engage bankers, risk officers, and strategists to validate key assumptions behind each metric.

3. **Prioritize Gaps by Impact-to-Effort Ratio**

   * Use this framework to drive sprint-level backlog refinement for analytics teams.

4. **Define Decision Use Cases Explicitly**

   * Require each dashboard or report to be mapped to a specific business decision and owner.
